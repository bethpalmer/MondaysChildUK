# Adapted from (http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/)

This is a one page responsive scrolling webiste created for Mondays Child UK.

## Bugs and Issues

In sections of this container div has been omitted deliberately, and used in conjunction with .no-gutter, to avoid unwanted margins around the edges of these sections.

Note: bootstrap.css file hacked to change all media queries below all entries marked /*here*/. All min-width:992px were changed from original min-width:767px, and all max-width:991px were changed from original max-width:768px. The reason for this being that I wanted to substitute navbar breakpoint from 768 to 992 in the quickest possible time.
