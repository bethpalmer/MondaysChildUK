# Adapted from (http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/)

This is a one page responsive scrolling webiste created for Mondays Child UK.

## Updates
Updates to content should be done via index.html

Updates to Photoswipe gallery photos should be done via js/photos.js.
There are 2 separate galleries in this file, one for course and one for fundraising, make sure you add photos to the correct one. The actual photos need to be added to img/galleryCourses or img/galleryFundraising.

## Bugs and Issues

In sections of this container div has been omitted deliberately, and used in conjunction with .no-gutter, to avoid unwanted margins around the edges of these sections.

Note: bootstrap.css file hacked to change all media queries below all entries marked /*here*/. All min-width:992px were changed from original min-width:767px, and all max-width:991px were changed from original max-width:768px. To substitute navbar breakpoint from 768 to 992 quickly.
